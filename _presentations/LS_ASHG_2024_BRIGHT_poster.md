The major histocompatibilty (MHC) locus explains the highest degree of autoimmune disease risk in the genome. Pathogenic HLA alleles may mediate disease via interactions with disease-associated cell states, which our group and others have defined using single-cell RNA-seq. Genotyping the HLA locus from scRNAseq data is hard due to the hyperpolymorphic nature of the MHC locus and the sparsity of single-cell data. We developed BRIGHT, integrating predictions from read-alignment-based and imputation-based HLA genotypers, to overcome these problems. Relative to existing tools, BRIGHT achieves state-of-the-art genotyping accuracy across HLA genes and common sequencing chemistries. For more, you can click the hyperlink above to read the poster.
